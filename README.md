# SwiftGraph
Spring 2019 Discrete Structures II (Math 307) Project

# Description
Implementation of graph theory concepts such as Graphs, Vertices, Edges, and Tours in Swift.
Implementation of Hierholzer's algorithm for finding Euler cycles and paths that works with this data. 
Also includes the GameScene.swift file built for macOS Swift applications that allows for easily drawing, manipulating, and running algorithms upon graphs.
