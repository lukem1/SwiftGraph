# SwiftGraph
Spring 2019 Discrete Structures II (Math 307) Project

# Description
Implementation of graph theory concepts such as Graphs, Vertices, Edges, and Tours in Swift.
Implementation of Hierholzer's algorithm for finding Euler cycles and paths that works with this data. 
Also includes the GameScene.swift file built for macOS Swift applications that allows for easily drawing, manipulating, and running algorithms upon graphs.

# Usage
Modes are selected using the keyboard
### euler (access by pressing "E")
Select a vertex by clicking on it and Hierholzer's algorithm will be run on the graph
If a Euler cycle or path is found, it will be animated
### modify (access by pressing "M")
Create vertices by clicking on empty space
Create edges by clicking and dragging from one vertex to another
Delete edges or vertices by clicking on it then pressing delete on the keyboard
### manipulate (access by pressing "S")
Click and drag vertices to move them around
### view (access by pressing "V")
Click on vertices/edges to display information about them
### Reset graph coloring by pressing "R" on the keyboard
